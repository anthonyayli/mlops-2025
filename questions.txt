What We Should Improve
1. Reproducibility & Configuration

We should add a configuration file (YAML/JSON) to centralize our hyperparameters, paths, and settings instead of hardcoding them
We need to implement random seed setting for reproducible results
We should version our data and models (consider DVC)

2. Error Handling & Validation

We need to add input validation (file existence, data schema checks)
We should implement proper exception handling with informative error messages
We need to add data quality checks between our pipeline steps

3. Logging & Monitoring

We should replace print statements with proper logging (using Python's logging module)
We need to log important metrics, parameters, and intermediate results
We should add timestamps and execution tracking

4. Code Quality

We need to add type hints to our functions
We should write unit tests for each script
We need to add docstrings explaining what each script does
We should implement proper code formatting (black, ruff)

5. Pipeline Orchestration

Our bash script is basic - we should consider adding:

Dependency checking between steps
Conditional execution (skip if output already exists)
Error handling (fail fast vs. continue)
Parallel execution where possible



6. Model Management

We should save model metadata (training date, parameters, metrics) alongside our pickle file
We need to implement model versioning
